# my-coding-journey
hii! here are all my projects from FreeCodeCamp! its my mini portfolio :)). note: some images and elements are not mine; credits to ownerr &lt;3

i started my FreeCodeCamp journey on Jan. 16, but i've been coding before that. 
i've made several games on Scratch and Tinker. here's a link to my game entitled "I Love to Preach" : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1186797575

now that i'm older (18 years old as of feb. 2026), i want to learn proper coding so that i can make an app!

my current goal is to make an online Bible reading player and tracker that can automatically play the audios for your daily Bible reading!!

i'll have updates here when i get started on it :))

thanks for stopping by and hope u can visit me again for updates hehe

bye!!
