# my-coding-journey
hii! 😊 here are all my projects from FreeCodeCamp! its my mini portfolio :)). note: some images and elements are not mine; credits to ownerr &lt;3

i started my FreeCodeCamp journey on Jan. 16, but i've been coding before that. 
i've made several games on Scratch and Tinker. here's a link to my game entitled "I Love to Preach" : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1186797575

now that i'm older (18 years old as of feb. 2026), i want to learn proper coding so that i can make an app!

my current goal is to make a budget app that's aesthetic !!

i'll have updates here when i get started on it :))

thanks for stopping by and hope u can visit me again for updates hehe

bye!!
